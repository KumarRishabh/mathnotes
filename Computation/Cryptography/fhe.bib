abstract = {Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as SVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the "learning from parity with error" problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for SVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical. We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystme such as the one by Ajtai and Dwork were based only on unique-SVP, a special case of SVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous cryptosystems: the public key is of size ¥tilde\{O\}(n\^{}2) and encrypting a message increases its size by a factor of ¥tilde\{O\}(n) (in previous cryptosystesms these values are ¥tilde\{O\}(n\^{}4) and ¥tilde\{O\}(n\^{}2), respectively). In fact, under the assumpption that all parties share a random bit string of length ¥tilde\{O\}(n\^{}2), the size of the public key can be reduced to ¥tilde\{O\}(n).},

abstract = {We construct public-key cryptosystems that are secure assuming theworst-case hardness of approximating the minimum distance on n-dimensional lattices to within small \$Poly(n)\$ factors. Prior cryptosystems with worst-case connections were based either on the shortest vector problem for a special class of lattices (Ajtai and Dwork, STOC 1997; Regev, J. ACM 2004), or on the conjectured hardness of lattice problems for quantum algorithms (Regev, STOC 2005). Our main technical innovation is a reduction from variants of the shortest vector problem to corresponding versions of the ``learning with errors'' (LWE) problem; previously, only a quantum reduction of this kind was known. As an additional contribution, we construct a natural chosen ciphertext-secure cryptosystem having a much simpler description and tighter underlying worst-case approximation factor than prior schemes.},

@article{Brakerski2012,
abstract = {We present a new tensoring technique for LWE-based fully homomorphic encryption. While in all previous works, the ciphertext noise grows quadratically (B¥rightarrowB\^{}2poly(n)) with every multiplication (before "refreshing"), our noise only grows linearly (B¥rightarrow B poly(n)). We use this technique to construct a scale-invariant fully homomorphic encryption scheme, whose properties only depend on the ratio between the modulus q and the initial noise level B, and not on their absolute values. Our scheme has a number of advantages over previous candidates: It uses the same modulus throught the evaluation process (no need for "modulus switching"), and this modulus can take arbitrary from, In addition, security can be classically reduced from the worst-case hardness of the GapSVP problem (with quasi-polynomial approximation factor), whereas previous constructions could only exhibit a quantum reduction from GapSVP.},

@article{Rothblum2011,
abstract = {We show that any private-key encryption scheme that is weakly homomorphic with respect to addition modulo 2, can be transformed into a public-key encryption scheme. The homomorphic feature referred to is a minimalistic one; that is, the length of a homomorphically generated encryption should be independent of the number of ciphertexts from which it was created. We do not require anything else on the distribution of homomorphically generated encryptions (in particular, we do not require them to be distributed like real ciphertexts). Our resulting public-key scheme is homomorphic in the following sense. If i+1 repeated applications of homomorphic operations can be applied to the private-key scheme, then i repeated applications can be applied to the public-key scheme.},

@article{VanDijk2010,
abstract = {We construct a simple fully homomorphic encryption scheme, using only elementary modular arithmetic. We use Gentry’s technique to construct a fully homomorphic scheme from a “bootstrappable” somewhat homomorphic scheme. However, instead of using ideal lattices over a polynomial ring, our bootstrappable encryption scheme merely uses addition and multiplication over the integers. The main appeal of our scheme is the conceptual simplicity. We reduce the security of our scheme to finding an approximate integer gcd – i.e., given a list of integers that are near-multiples of a hidden integer, output that hidden integer. We investigate the hardness of this task, building on earlier work of Howgrave-Graham.},
