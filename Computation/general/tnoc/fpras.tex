\begin{df}
A \vocab{fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS)} is one that for any $\ep,\de$ computes a $(1+\ep)$-approximation with probability $1-\de$ in time $\poly(n,\lg \rc{\de},\lg \rc{\ep})$.
\end{df}
(Note it suffices to find an algorithm for $\de=\fc23$, as the error probability can be reduced exponentially by amplification.)
