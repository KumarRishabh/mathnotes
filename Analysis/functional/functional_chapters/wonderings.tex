\chapter{Questions}

This is a record of questions I asked myself to help understand the material, or think about it further.

(Re: Theorem~\ref{thm:f6-7}) What's an example of when $\si_B$ is larger than $\si_A$?
\end{enumerate}
\section{Holomorphic functional calculus}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
(Runge's Theorem~\ref{thm:f7-2}) {\it What is the obstruction to approximation by polynomials?} It's Cauchy's integral formula. Consider $\rc x$ defined in an annulus. Taking an integral around the circle once gives $2\pi i$. It's 0 for any polynomial.
\item
{\it What goes wrong in Stone-Weierstrass?} We need the algebra to be {\it self-adjoint}, and the conjugate of a holomorphic function is typically not a holomorphic function (unless it's constant?)! ($\ol z$ is not holomorphic.) Stone-Weierstrass takes us out of the analytic world.
\item
\end{enumerate}
