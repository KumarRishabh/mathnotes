\section{Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function}
%Real-variable theory
Throughout we work in $\R^n$.
\begin{df}
Given a function $f$, define the \vocab{maximal function} as the maximal average of absolute value over balls centered at $f$.
\[
Uf(x)=\sup_{r>0} \rc{m(B(x,r))} \int_{B(x,r)} |f(y)|\,dy.
\]
\end{df}
\begin{thm}[Maximal inequality]\label{thm:max-ineq}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
For all $\al>0$, 
\[
m(\set{x}{Mf(x)>\al})\precsim \rc{\al}\int |f|\,dx.
\]
This essentially says that if $f\in L^1$, then $Mf\in L^{1,\iy}$. 
\item If $f\in L^p$ and $1<p\le \iy$, then $Mf\in L^p$, and 
\[
\ve{Mf}_{L^p}\precsim \ve{f}_{L^p}.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
To prove this we need the covering lemma. 
\begin{lem}[Vitali covering lemma]\label{lem:covering}
Let $E$ be a nonempty measurable set, covered by balls $B_1,\ldots, B_M$. There exists a subcollection $\{B_1,\ldots, B_N\}$ that is mutually disjoint and
\[
\sum_{k=1}^N m(B_k) \ge 3^n m(E).
\]
\end{lem}
%We can choose a disjoint subcollection that gives us some control over the original collection.

Suppose we have some weird set $E$. If we can cover it by a finite collection of balls, we can find a disjoint subcollection that still tells us something about the measure of $E$.

\begin{proof}
Use the greedy method (``analysis is being greedy").
Let $B_1\in \{B_\al\}$ have the largest radius. Let $B_2$ be the ball disjoint from $B_1$ which has largest radius, and so forth.

They are mutually disjoint by construction. Suppose $B\in \{B_\al\}$ which is not one of $B_1,\ldots, B_N$. Then for some $l$, $B\cap B_\ell\ne \phi$. Suppose $B_l$ is the largest (first) ball that it intersects. Then $r(B_l)>r(B)$ because otherwise $B$ would have been chosen instead of $B_l$ at that stage. Then the dilation of $B_l$ by a factor of 3 covers $B$: $B\subeq 3B_l$. 

Then $3B_1,\ldots, 3B_N$ cover $E$, so
\[
m(E)\le \sum_{k=1}^N m(3B_k)=3^n \sum_{k=1}^N m(B_k).
\]
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of maximal inequality~\ref{thm:max-ineq}]
Define the \vocab{uncentered maximal function} by 
\[
\wt M f(x)=\sup_{B\ni x} \rc{m(B)} \int_B|f(y)|\,dy.
\]
It's clear that $Mf(x)\le \wt Mf(x)$.

It suffices to prove the theorem for $\wt Mf$.

Set
\[
E_\al = \set{x}{\wt Mf(x)>\al}.
\]
For all $x\in E_\al$, there exists $B_x\ni x$ such that 
\[
\rc{m(B_x)}\int_{B_x} |f(y)|\,dy>\al,
\]
i.e. $m(B_x)\le \rc{\al}\int_{B_x}|f(y)|\,dy$. Let measure of $E$ can be made arbitrarily close to that of $E_\al$ because of inner regularity.)
Let  $\{B_x\}_{x\in E_\al}$ be a collection of balls 
 that cover $E_\al$. %(It suffices to look at compact subsets because $E_\al$ is measurable.) 
By compactness we can choose a finite number $B_1,\ldots, B_M$ that cover $E$. By the Covering Lemma~\ref{lem:covering} we can choose $B_1,\ldots, B_N$ mutually disjoint and $\sum_{k=1}^N m(B_k)\ge 3^{-n} m(E)$. We have an upper bound on this already:
\bal
m(E)&\le 3^n \sum_{k=1}^N m(B_k)\\
&\le \fc{3^n}{\al} \sum_{k=1}^N\int_{B_f}|f(y)|\,dy\\
&\le \fc{3^n}{\al}\int |f|\,dx\\
\implies m(E_\al)&\precsim \rc{\al} \int|f|\,dx.
\end{align*}
%Inner regular (compact)
\end{proof}
The norm is independent of the dimension.

\begin{df}
Let $f$ be measurable. The \vocab{distribution function} of $f$ is a function $\la_f(\al):[0,\iy)\to [0,\iy)$ given by
\[
\la_f(\al)=m(\{|f(x)|>\al\}).
\]
\end{df}
This gives us useful information. For example, 
\[
\int|f|^p\,dx=p\int_0^{\iy} \al^{p-1}\la_f(\al)\,dx.
\]
``Cut the cake" horizontally.
\begin{proof}[Proof of part 2 of Theorem~\ref{thm:max-ineq}]
Let $f\in L^p$, $1<p<\iy$. Then
\[
\int|\wt Mf(x)|^p\,dx=
p\int_0^{\iy} \al^{p-1}m\pa{\set{x}{\wt Mf(x)>\al}}\,dx
\le 
p\int_0^{\iy} \al^{p-1}m\pa{\set{x}{\wt Mg(x)>\fc{\al}2}}\,dx.
\]
where
\[
g(x):=\begin{cases}
|f(x)|,&|f(x)|>\fc{\al}{2}\\
0,&\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
We show the last inequality.
The new function $g$ contains all the information we need.
We know
\bal
|f(x)|&\le \max\{g(x),\fc{\al}{2}\}\\
&\le |g(x)|+\fc{\al}2.
\end{align*}
This translates to the maximal function.
\bal
\wt Mf(x)&\le \wt Mg(x)+\fc{\al}{2}\\
\wt Mf(x)>\al&\implies \wt Mg(x)>\fc{\al}2\\
\{\wt Mf(x)>\al\}&\subeq \{\wt M g(x)>\fc{\al}2\}.
\end{align*}
%only supported where $f$ is large, so we can use the first inequality. $g\in L^1$. The only it can fail is by blowing up somewhere. But $p>1$.
We have
\bal
\int|\wt Mf(x)|^p\,dx&\precsim \int_0^{\iy} \al^{p-1}\rc{\al}\pa{\int_{\R^n}|g(x)|\,dx}\,d\al\\
&=\int_0^{\iy} \al^{p-2} \pa{\int_{\set{x}{|f(x)|>\fc{\al}2}}|f(x)|\,dx}\,d\al\\
&=\int_{\R^n} |f(x)|\pa{\int_0^{2|f(x)|}\al^{p-1}\,d\al}\,dx \precsim \int|f|^p\,dx.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
Let's build up what we need for the Calderon-Zygmund decomposition. First we need another (more annoying) covering lemma.

We can cover the complement of a closed set with cubes, where the diameter of the cube is proportion to the distance from the cube to the set. 
\begin{lem}[Whitney decomposition]\label{lem:whitney}
Let $F$ be a nonempty closed set. There exists a sequence of almost disjoint cubes (intersecting only on a set of measure 0, i.e., their boundary) $\{Q_k\}$ such that 
\[
F^c=\bigcup Q_k,
\]
and there exists $C>0$ such that 
\[
\diam(Q_k)\le d(Q_k,F)\le C\diam(Q_k).
\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
%Consider cubes 
Let $M_0$ be cubes of unit side length with vertices in $\Z^n$.

Define $M_{k}$ by bisecting each cube in $M_{k-1}$, so that $M_k$ consists of cubes with side length $2^{-k}$, vertices $2^{-k}\Z^n$. (This is the ``dyadic decomposition.")

Let $\Om=F^c$; set
%bands around the original set
\[
\Om_k = \set{x\in \R^n}{C2^{-k}\le d(x,F)\le 2C2^{-k}},
\] 
where $C$ is a constant to be chosen. Think of them as bands around the original set.

For $Q\in M_k$, include $Q\in \cal F$ if $Q\cap \Om_k\ne \phi$.
We need a lower bound of the distance of the cube to the original set $F$. Let $x\in Q$. Then 
\bal
d(x,F)&\ge C2^{-k}-\ub{\diam(Q)}{\sqrt n2^{-k}}\\
&=(C-\sqrt n) 2^{-k} \ge \sqrt n 2^{-k} =\diam(Q).
\end{align*}
where we take $C=2\sqrt n$. This gives one direction.

For the other, 
\bal
d(Q,F)&\le 2C2^{-k}&\text{since it intersects the band}\\
&=2\cdot 2\sqrt{n}2^{-k}\\
&=4d(Q).
\end{align*}
For all $Q\in \cal F$, we have
\[
\diam (Q)\le d(Q,F)\le 4\diam(Q).
\]
We also have to remove redundant cubes. Proof omitted. %any cube in collection that contains it can only be so large. Get small cube by bisecting fixed number of times; get rid of smaller cubes.

\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Calderon-Zygmund decomposition]
Let $f\in L^1$. Fix $\al>0$. Then there exists a decomposition $f=g+\sum_{k}b_k$ and a sequence of almost disjoint cubes $\{Q_k\}$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
(the good part is bounded) $|g(x)|\le \al$,
\item $\Supp(b_k)\subeq Q_k$, $\int_{Q_k} b_k=0$, and $\int|b_k(x)|\precsim \al\cdot m(Q_k)$,
\item $\sum m(Q_k)\precsim \rc{\al}\int |f|\,dx$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
Bounds ($\precsim$) depend only on the dimension.

This is very useful. To construct $g,b_k$, it's tempting to just cut off $f$ at $\al$. But the correct thing to do is to cut off the maximal function at $\al$. %gives us more control.

Idea: The bad set will be covered by a bunch of cubes; if you dilate the cubes by a fixed factor it intersects the good set, so you have a bound on the maximal function.
\begin{proof}
%apply whitney decomp to compl?
We cutoff where $\wt Mf(x)>\al$. Let $E_{\al}=\set{x}{\wt Mf(x)>\al}$. $E_{\al}^c$ is closed (WLOG nonempty and not all of $\R^n$). Apply Whitney decomposition~\ref{lem:whitney} to cover $E_\al$ by $\{Q_k\}$. Set
\[
g(x)=\begin{cases}
|f(x)|,&x\in E_\al^c\\
\rc{m(Q_k)}\int_{Q_k} f(y)\,dy,&x\in Q_k\\
0,&\text{elsewhere.}%edges where intersect, for consistency.
\end{cases}
\]
%The remaining piece will have 0 average.
On $E_\al^c$ we have $|f(x)|\precsim |\wt Mf(x)|\le \al$. %Lebesgue differentiation theorem, have it almost everywhere.
\begin{clm*}
We have $|g(x)|\precsim \al$ almost everywhere.
\end{clm*}
If $x\in Q_k$ (This is a set completely contained in the bad region, but we can blow it up so that it overlaps the good region.),
\bal
|g(x)|&\le \rc{m(Q_k)}\int_{Q_k}|f(y)|\,dy \\
&\le \fc{4^n}{m(Q_k^*)}\int_{Q_k^*} |f(y)|\,dy&Q_k^*:=4Q_k\\
&\precsim\al.
\end{align*}
Let 
\[
b_k(x)=\chi_{Q_k}(x)\pa{
f(x)-\rc{m(Q_k)}\int_{Q_k} f(y)\,dy
};
\]
note that $\int b_k(x)=0$; we have $f=g+\sum b_k$.
%Notice that if you integrate over $Q_k$, this will give you 0.

Now we need to estimate the $L^1$ norm of each. We find (the ``$\le \al$" comes from taking $x\in Q_k^*\cap E_\al$ and noting $\rc{m(Q_k^*)}\int_{Q_k^*}|f(y)|\,dy\le \wt Mf(x)$  by definition of $\wt Mf$)
\bal
\int |b_k(x)|\,dx&\le 2\int_{Q_k} |f(y)|\,dy\\
& \le \int_{Q_k^*}|f(y)|\,dy \\
&=m(Q_k^*)\cdot \ub{\rc{m(Q_k^*)} \int_{Q_k^*} |f(y)|\,dy
}{\le \al}\\
&\precsim \al m(Q_k^*)\precsim \al m(Q_k)\\
\sum m(Q_k)
%cover bad set 
&=m(\set{x}{\wt Mf(x)>\al})\\
&\precsim \rc{\al}\int|f|\,dx.
\end{align*}

\end{proof}
What can you do with this decomposition? You can estimate in singular integrals. This comes up in $L^p$ elliptic regularity results for Laplace's equation. There's an integral kernel that can be estimated using Calderon-Zygmund.
